at first, we wanted to do leaf as a block, but then we noticed we couldn't because some properties 
of block are not properties of leaf (e.g. block mass is immovable, leaf mass is 0)
so we did leaf as a separate Class but extends GameObject

we created an extra terrain at the initialization of the game. then when ever the avatar is 
too close to the end of the screen (on either sides) we deleted the unnecessary terrain and added 
torwards the avatar direction

we only added leaf, for the reason mentioned above

we had no dilemmas because we rock. but we added grass because what is life without some grass ;)

we put Miri image as the avatar because she is very much appreciated, and when she flies she turns
in 90 degrees. And that the way the cookie crumble
